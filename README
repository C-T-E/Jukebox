Before running jukebox.py.

3. go to your spotify, login create new list call queue list right click on
queue list copy playlist uri and paste it on credentials.py under queue_uri ='HERE'.
the playlist uri you do the same.

4. Application keys

Every app that use libspotify needs its own libspotify application key.
Application keys can be obtained automatically and free of charge from Spotify.

Go to the Spotify developer pages and login using your Spotify account.
Find the libspotify application keys management page and request an 
application key for your application.
Once the key is issued, download the “binary” version. 
The “C code” version of the key will not work with pyspotify.
If you place the application key in the same directory as your 
application’s main Python file, pyspotify will automatically find it and use it. 
If you want to keep the application key in another location, you’ll need to 
set application_key in your session config or call load_application_key_file() 
to load the session key file correctly.

I put it in the same directory!
